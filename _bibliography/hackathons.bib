    <b>Task</b>: Predict COVID-19 infection from reported symptoms<br>
    <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://github.com/nshomron/covidpred" target="_blank">English translation of COVID infections reported by Israeli Ministry of Health</a><br>
    <b>Learning objectives</b>:
    <ul>
      <li>Explore a realistic dataset and prepare it for building a practical machine learning system</li>
      <li>Think through various practical issues related to deploying such a system (e.g., class imbalance, data collection bias)</li>
      <li>Build and train such an ML system addressing the issues discovered above</li>
    </ul>
